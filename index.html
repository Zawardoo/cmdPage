          Hello and welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Jozef and I'm a
          cybersecurity enthusiast. Although I'm relatively new to the field,
          I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a professional.
          <br /><br />
          <br />
          I have experience in software testing, specifically with banking
          software, APIs, and Oracle and MS databases. This experience has given
          me a unique perspective on cybersecurity and helped me develop the
          skills needed to identify vulnerabilities and potential risks.
          <br /><br />
          On my portfolio site, you'll find examples of my latest projects that
          showcase my web development and penetration testing skills. I enjoy
          solving challenges and am always looking for new opportunities to
          apply and expand my knowledge.
          <br /><br />
          If you're looking for a dedicated and detail-oriented cybersecurity
          professional, I would love the opportunity to work with you. Please
          feel free to browse my portfolio and contact me with any questions or
          potential collaborations.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for visiting my portfolio site, and I look forward to
          connecting with you!
